# huffman-code
Use Huffman code theory and  Huffman compression algorithm  to compress a binary data sheet into different sequences
huffman.py is the real solution of the whole project
566.bin is the binary data sheet
solution.py is another solution we dissuceed but can not make it successfully finished
